  Cut fat into flour until texture is that of course bread crumbs.  Add chilled water a few tablespoons at a time, cutting in with knife until pastry can be gathered into a ball without crumbling.  Keep as dry as possible and do not work too much.  Chill pie crust while assembling filling.



  Peel, core and slice apples, place in mixing bowl.  Add remaining ingredients and fold together.  



  Divide pastry dough in two and roll out one portion for bottom crust.  Place in 10 inch round pie dish and trim edges.  Place filling into crust.  Roll out remaining portion of dough.  Moisten edges of bottom crust and place top crust on pie.  Trim and crimp edges to create a seal.  Moisten top of pie and sprinkle with regular sugar for a crisp top.  Cut four slits in top crust before placing in 350 degree oven.  Bake until golden brown, approximately 45 minutes.  You should be able to see filling bubbling when pie is cooked.
