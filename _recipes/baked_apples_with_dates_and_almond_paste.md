title: Baked Apples with Dates and Almond Paste
subtitle: null
description: Interesting twist on a traditional English standard
ingredients:
  - 2 apples (Winesaps, Cortlands or Rome)
  - Dates
  - 3 oz ground almonds
  - 3 oz brown sugar
  - Â½ teasp cinnamom
  - water
directions: |-
  Heat oven to 350 degrees.

  Core apples using an apple corer.  Stuff resulting holes in the apples with dates.  With a sharp knife cut through the skin of the apples all the way around the middle, to allow room for apples to expand when cooking.  Place in oven-proof dish.

  Mix together remaining ingredients using enough water to make a loose paste, stiff enough so that most of it sticks to the apples.

  Place apples in oven and cook for approximately one hour or until apples are soft through when pierced with a knife.

  Serve with sour cream, creme fraiche or mascarpone.  We prefer sour cream unless you can get sour cooking apples.
servings: "2"
