description: Barley Risotto
ingredients:
  - 4 1/2 cups chicken stock
  - 1 finely chopped onion
  - 1 cup pearl barley
  - 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme or 3/4 teaspoon dried
  - 1 bay leaf
  - olive oil
  - 8 oz assorted fresh mushrooms, sliced
  - 2 garlic cloves, minced
  - 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley
  - 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for serving
directions: |-
  In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a simmer over moderately high heat. Reduce the heat to low and keep warm.

  In a large, deep skillet, heat the olive oil. Add the onion and thyme and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened, about 6 minutes. 

  Add the barley and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of the warm stock and cook, stirring, until nearly absorbed. Continue adding the stock 1/2 cup at a time and stirring until it is nearly absorbed between additions. 

  Meanwhile, heat oil in another large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add mushrooms, sautÃ© until beginning to brown, add garlic, cook about 3 minutes. 

  The risotto is done when the barley is al dente and suspended in a thick, creamy sauce, about 35 minutes. 

  Mix in parsley and garlic mixture. Stir in the 1/2 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano and the butter and season with salt and pepper. 

  Serve at once, passing more cheese at the table.
