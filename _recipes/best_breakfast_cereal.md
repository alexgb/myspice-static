title: Best Breakfast Cereal
subtitle: null
description: Cross between meusli and granola, but less sweet.
ingredients:
  - 1 Package Sam's Cereal (wheat flakes with flax seeds)
  - 1/2 lb Old Fashioned Rolled Oats
  - 1/4 lb slivered almonds
  - 1/4 lb whole almonds
  - 1/4 lb pecans
  - 1/4 lb each of 3-4 dried fruits (apricots, apples, raisins, blueberrys
    cranberrys, cherries, dates, etc.)
  - 1/4 lb unsweetened dessicated coconut (optional)
  - Cinnamon (optional)
  - 2 oz sunflower seeds
directions: |-
  Bake oats, slivered almonds and coconut in oven, in separate pans, until they are lightly browned.  Mix all ingredients in a large bowl and store in airtight containers.

  You can add any number of different nuts, seeds and dried fruits according to your tastes.  Brown sugar can be added to sweeten but we find the dried fruits add enough sweetness by themselves.

  Serve with milk or yoghurt and optional fresh fruits for a very healthy start to the day.
servings: "20"
