title: Braised Cabbage
subtitle: Braised Cabbage
description: World's best braised cabbage.
ingredients:
  - 1 medium head green cabbage (2 pounds)
  - 1 large yellow onion, thickly sliced
  - 1 large carrot, ¼ in rounds
  - ¼ cup chicken broth
  - ¼ cup olive oil
  - course salt and black pepper
  - ⅛ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
  - course sea salt for garnish
directions: |-
  Heat oven to 325° and lightly grease a 9 x 13 baking dish.

  Peel outer layers from cabbage. Cut the cabbage into 8 wedges and arrange in the baking dish so that they overlap as little as possible.

  Scatter in the onion and carrots. Drizzle with oil and stock. Season with salt, pepper, and pepper flakes. Cover tightly with foil and place in oven to cook for about 2 hours. Turn the cabbage wedges over after an hour. If the dish is drying out add a splash of water.

  Once the cabbage is tender, remove the foil and increase the temperature to 400°. Roast until the vegetables begin to brown, another 15 minutes or so. Serve warm or at room temperature spindled with coarse sea salt.
servings: "6"
