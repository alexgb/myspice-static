  - Cheese Grits Filling - 

  Pour milk and water into a 2-quart saucepan, cover, and bring to a boil. Uncover the pot and add the grits and salt, and reduce the heat to medium. Stir constantly until the grits are the consistency of thick soup and release a fragrance of corn, about 8 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring every 2 to 3 minutes, for about 20 minutes, until the grits fall lazily from the end of the spoon. Cook about 15 minutes more, stirring constantly. 

  When the grits are creamy and fluffy, turn off the heat, add the pepper, butter, and 1/4 cup cheese. Stir to incorporate. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

  - Chiles Rellenos and Sauce

  Core the tomato and arrange on a 13 x 9 inch baking pan with peppers, onion, and garlic, with the peppers gathered at one end. Brush all the vegetables with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Place the pan under a broiler, with the peppers nearest you. Turn the peppers every 3 minutes until their skins are blistered on all sides and the onion, garlic, and tomato are charred as well. Transfer the peppers to a large bowl, transfer the tomato, onion, and garlic to a medium bowl, and let them cool. Set aside the roasting pan.

  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

  When the peppers are cool enough to handle, gently remove their skins and discard. Cut a 3-inch slit down the side of each pepper and gently spoon out the seeds and veins. Fill each pepper with 1/2 cup cheese grits and place in the roasting pan. 

  When the tomato, onion, and garlic have cooled, remove the skins from the tomato and garlic and discard. Process the tomato, onion, and garlic to a chunky puree in a food processor, about 30 seconds. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce over the peppers.

  Bake the peppers on the middle rack until the tomato sauce bubbles gently, about 15 minutes. Scatter the cheese on top and place the pan under the broiler until the cheese has browned.
