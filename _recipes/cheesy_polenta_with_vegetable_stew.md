ingredients:
  - 1 cup Polenta
  - 1 cup grated white cheddar cheese
  - 1 minced jalapenos pepper
  - 2 cloves of garlic
  - 1 white onion
  - 1 medium eggplant, peeled and coarsely chopped, about 2 cups
  - 2 medium or 1 large zucchini, chopped, about 3 cups
  - 1 1arge yellow bell pepper, chopped about 1.5 cups
  - 1 large tomato, chopped, abotu 1 cup
  - 1 -2 cups, depending, chopped tomatos (Pomi)
  - 1 cup chopped fresh parsely
  - 2 tbsp red pepper flakes
  - a few dashes of dried basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary
  - parmesan cheese, I like a good amount
  - Salt
  - Pepper
  - Olive Oil
  - 1/2 cup, depending, Vegetable Stock
  - 1/2 cup dry white wine, optional
directions: |-
  Boil 4 cups of water. Slowly whisk in 1 cup of dried Polenta. Simmer and stir frequently for 5 - 10 minutes Whisk in cheese, jalapenos, and a little salt until completely blended. Pour into casserole dish or baking pan and put in the refrigerator to cool for at least 1/2 hour. Some say 2 hours, but 1/2 hour works just fine.

  Chop all vegetables. In a large pot/saucepan, on medium heat 2 tablespoon of olive oil until hot. Stir in and cook onions, eggplant and garlic and cook for 5 - 10 minutes, until onions are transparent, but don't burn the garlic! Add zucchini, pepper, and tomatoes. Add olive oil as necessary to prevent burning, but don't over do it. Stir in chopped tomatoes from package. Add parmesan, spices and salt and pepper. Stirring all the time. Slowly add white wine and/or vegetable stock to create a saucy base. Simmer for about 40 minutes. Higher heat can be used but reduce cooking time to about 30 minutes Until all vegetables are nice texture to eat...whatever your preference is!

  Remove Polenta from fridge and cut into square (hearts, stars, or circles, whatever). Spatula onto plates and top with delicious vegetable stew. Enjoy!
