title: Chengde Rice Noodles with Red-Braised Beef
subtitle: Jin Shi Niu Rou Fen
description: Light noodles with rich and savory beef.
ingredients:
  - 1 pound braising beef steak
  - 2 tablespoons beef dripping or peanut oil
  - 2 1/2 tablespoons chili bean paste
  - A few slices fresh ginger, unpeeled
  - 2 pieces cassia bark
  - 1 star anise
  - 1 tablespoon shaoxing wine
  - 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
  - 1 scallion
  - 1/4 teaspoon whole sichuan peppercorn
  - 1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds
  - 3 cardamom pods
directions: |-
  1. Cut the beef into bite size cubes. Place in a saucepan with cold water to cover and bring to a boil over a high flame, skimming off the froth that rises to the surface. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon and set aside. Skim the cooking liquid again if necessary, then strain into a jug; set aside.

  2. Heat the dripping or oil in a clean pan or a wok over a medium flame. Add the chili bean paste and stir-fry until the oil is red and fragrant. Add the ginger, cassia, and star anise and continue to stir-fry until you can smell their wonderful aromas.

  3. Tip in the beef and toss in the fragrant oil spices. Add enough of the cooking liquid to cover generously, along with the other ingredients. (The seeds can be tied in a piece of cheesecloth if you have some to hand.) Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, partially cover the wok or pan, and simmer for 2-3 hours over a very low flame, until tender.

  4. Serve the noodles with stock and optionally green vegetables, adding a little chopped coriander to the seasonings in each bowl.
