ingredients:
  - one 4lb chicken
  - Brine
  - 1 lemons, halved
  - 3 bay leaves
  - 3 sprigs flat leaf parsley
  - 2 sprigs thyme
  - 2 tablespoons honey
  - 4 garlic cloves, halved
  - 1 tablespoon peppercorns
  - 3 tablespoons salt
  - water
  - 12 extra large shrimp, shells on
  - chile powder
  - canola oil
  - 4 serrano chiles, thinly sliced
  - 1 cup green beans
  - 1/2 cup chicken stock
  - 1 chorizo sausage, cut into 1/4 diagonal slices
  - 1/4 cup dry white wine
  - 18 small mussels
  - flat leaf parsley leaves
  - salt and black pepper
directions: |-
  Cut the chicken into thighs, legs, wings, and 4 pieces of breast.

  Place the chicken in a bowl and cover with brine ingredients and just enough water to cover. Refrigerate for 12 hours.

  Prepare saffron rice.

  Preheat oven to 400°.

  Remove the chicken from the brine and rinse. Pat throughly dry.

  Without removing the shells devein the shrimp by cutting along the back with a sharp pairing knife and rinse.

  Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and chile powder. Heat some canola oil on a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken in batches skin-side down being careful not to crowd. Cook pieces over medium-low heat for about 8 minutes per side, until skin is a deep golden brown.

  Spread the saffron rice evenly across the bottom of an baking dish. Arrange the half the peppers and half the green beans over the rice. Tuck the chicken pieces into the rice, pour in the stock and put the dish in the oven.

  Add the chorizo to the frying pan, using more oil if necessary, and cook until browned on the edges, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the chorizo to a plate and pour off excess fat from the pan. Add the shrimp to the pan and sauté until just cooked, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer the shrimp to a plate.

  Add the wine to the pan, bring to a boil, and boil for 30 seconds. Add the mussels, cover the pan and cook until the mussels have opened, 2 to 3 minutes.

  Remove the baking dish from the oven and arrange the chorizo, shrimp, and mussels in the dish. Return the frying pan to the heat, add the remaining peppers and green beans and heat through. Add them to the baking dish, and garnish with parsley leaves and sea salt.
