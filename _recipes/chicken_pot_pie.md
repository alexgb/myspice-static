subtitle: A Jess Dang Creation
description: It's a chicken pot pie
ingredients:
  - 2 Pie Crusts
  - 1 pound chicken breast
  - 1/2 Cup Chopped Onion
  - 3 Tbsp butter
  - 3 tbsp flour
  - 1 cup milk
  - 2 cups broth
  - (dried mushrooms soaked in chicken broth)
  - "1/2 cup each: carrot, celery, leeks, peas, mushrooms"
directions: |-
  Make pie crusts, set aside

  Poach (or, in my case, boil because I don't know how to poach) chicken and tear into pieces

  Prep and saute together all the veggies

  Make roux with onion, butter, flour, then gradually add milk and broth until you have a nice consistency, add seasoning as you like (I think I used thyme)

  Throw solids into bottom crust, cover with liquid, add top crust, cut slits for steam to escape

  Bake at 425 for 30-35 min, let cool for another 10
servings: many (it's heavy)
