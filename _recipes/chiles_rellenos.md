title: Chiles Rellenos
subtitle: Stuffed Chilies
description: The chile relleno, literally “stuffed Chile” is a traditional
  Mexican dish. This recipe covers the basic cheese stuffed variety with tomato
  sauce.  Though time consuming to make, this recipe never lets down.
ingredients:
  - 6 Anaheim or Pablano Chiles
  - 8 Ounces Jack Cheese
  - 1/3 Cup Flour
  - 1 Tablespoon Butter
  - 3 Tablespoons Chopped Onion
  - 1 Garlic Clove
  - 15 Ounces Tomato Puree
  - 1/4 Teaspoon Oregano
  - 4 Eggs
  - Salt
  - Vegetable Oil
directions: |-
  Place chiles under a broiler or over a direct flame to blacken and bubble the skins. Rotate the chiles until they have blackened all the way around. When finished seal them in a plastic bag for 10 minutes and let cool. Then peel the skins off while holding under cool running water.

  Slit each chile three-quarters down length of one side; pullout ribs and seeds, leaving stem intact.

  Cut cheese into six 1/2-inch-thick pieces slightly smaller than chiles; insert a piece into each chile. Roll chiles in flour, shaking off excess. Set aside. In a medium-size frying pan, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring, until golden (about 10 minutes). Add tomato puree and oregano; season to taste with salt. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes; keep warm.

  Meanwhile, prepare Crispy Egg Coating. Pour oil to a depth of 11/2 inches into a wide frying pan and heat to 425°F on a deep-frying thermometer. When oil is hot, hold each chile by its stem and dip into egg coating. (For canned chiles, drop them into egg coating and lift out with 2 forks.) Drop into hot oil and cook, 2 or 3 at a time, until golden on both sides (about 2 minutes total), turning once with a fork and spatula. Drain on paper towels. 

  Offer hot chiles with tomato sauce to spoon on individual servings. Makes 6 servings.

  Crispy Egg Coating:

  Separate 4 eggs. In a large bowl, whip whites with 1 teaspoon salt until firm peaks form. Beat yolks until blended; then quickly fold into whites. Use at once.
