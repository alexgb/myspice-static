title: Chinese Marbled Tea Egg
subtitle: Chinese Marbled Tea Egg
description: Generally eaten at room temperature or just slightly warm. In
  Northern China, Chinese Tea Eggs symbolize golden nuggets for the Chinese New
  Year feast.
ingredients:
  - 6 eggs
  - 3/4 cup soy sauce
  - 2 star anise
  - 2 tablespoons black tea (or 2 tea bags)
  - 1 cinnamon stick
  - 1 teaspoon sugar
  - 1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorn (optional)
  - 2 strips dried tangerine or mandarin orange peel (optional)
directions: |-
  Gently place the eggs in a medium pot and fill with water to cover the eggs by 1-inch. Bring the pot to a boil, lower the heat and let simmer for 3 minutes. 

  Remove the eggs (leaving the water in the pot) and let cool under running cool water. 

  Using the back of the teaspoon, gently tap the eggshell to crack the shell all over. The more you tap, the more intricate the design. Do this with a delicate hand to keep the shell intact. 

  To the same pot with the boiling water, return the eggs and add in the remaining ingredients. Bring the mixture to a boil and immediately turn the heat to low. 

  Simmer for 40 minutes, cover with lid and let eggs steep for a few hours to overnight. The longer you steep, the more flavorful and deeply marbled the tea eggs will be.
