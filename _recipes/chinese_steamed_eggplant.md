title: Chinese Steamed Eggplant
subtitle: Fuschia Dunlop's cool-steamed eggplant with garlic dressing
description: Great way to eat eggplant that isn't nearly as heavy as the typical
  fried eggplant style. The original recipe calls for serving this cool, but I
  think it's great served warm as a side.
ingredients:
  - 1 lb eggplants
  - 2 tbsp light soy sauce
  - 1 tsp Chinkiang vinegar
  - ¼ tsp sugar
  - 1 tbsp finely chopped garlic
  - 1 tbsp finely chopped fresh ginger
  - 1 ½ tbsp thinly sliced spring onions, green parts only
  - 2 tbsp cooking oil
directions: |-
  Cut the eggplants into 1/2" slices, then cut these into 1/2" strips. Cut the strips into 2-3" long segments and pile them into a bowl that will fit inside your steamer basket.



  Place the bowl in the steamer basket and steam over high for 20 minute, until tender. Combine the soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar in a small bowl.



  Shortly before you wish to serve them, pile the eggplants in a serving dish and top them with garlic, ginger, and spring onion.



  Heat the oil in the seasoned wok or saucepan over high heat until it is very hot. Carefully ladle the hot oil over the garlic, ginger, and spring onions - it should produce a sizzle.



  Pour over the soy sauce mixture. Stir the seasonings gently into the aubergines and serve.
servings: 2-4
