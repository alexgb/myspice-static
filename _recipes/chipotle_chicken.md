description: A spicy and aromatic filling for tacos.
ingredients:
  - 2 tablespoons canola or olive oil
  - 1 small onion, finely chopped
  - 2 cloves of garlic, crushed
  - Â¾ teaspoon dried oregano, freshly crumbled
  - Â¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  - 1 cup chicken broth
  - 1 (14Â½ oz.) can whole tomatoes, chopped, with juice
  - 1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken thighs (or breasts if you prefer)
  - 1 to 2 chipotle peppers canned in adobo sauce, finely chopped
  - 1 cinnamon stick
  - 1 whole piece of star anise
  - salt to taste
directions: |-
  Heat the oil over a medium flame in a large saucepan. Add onion, garlic, oregano, and pepper. Cook until the onion begins brown then add the stock, the juice from the tomatoes, and the chicken. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for 10 minutes. 

  Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside to cool. Add chopped tomatoes, chipotle peppers, cinnamon, and star anise to the pot, and simmer 15-20 minutes, until the liquid is reduced in half and has thickened. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the meat into bite-size pieces. Return chicken to the pot and simmer until it is heated through. Remove the whole spices before serving.
