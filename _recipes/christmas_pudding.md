directions: |-
  Mix all ingredients together, then fill two 7" pudding bowls leaving an inch of space at the top. Cover each bowl with square piece of parchment paper and crimp paper tightly around lip of bowl. Now cover again with piece of cloth and tie around bowl under lip so that string cannot slip over lip, then tie loose ends together over the top of the bowl so that it can be lifted. Put pudding bowl in pot half way submerged in water and steam for 3 hours. When finished cooking remove paper and cloth and replace with clean foil; store in fridge.

  When required steam for further 3 hours and serve with brandy or rum butter, cream, or a rich white sauce flavored with brandy or rum. Decorate with holly and pour over a flaming ladle of brandy to serve.
