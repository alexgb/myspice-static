title: Greek-Style Grilled Chicken with Oregano, Garlic, Lemon, and Olive Oil
subtitle: Butterflied BBQ chicken
description: Tender, succulent, smokey, and citrusy chicken.
ingredients:
  - 3 lemons
  - 5 cloves garlic, minced
  - 3 tablespoons minced fresh oregano
  - 1/4 cup olive oil
  - Salt and black pepper
  - 1 whole chicken
directions: |-
  Grate 2 teaspoons zest from 1 lemon into large bowl. Squeeze 3 tablespoons lemon juice into bowl. Add garlic and oregano. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle olive oil to form an emulsion. Season to taste with salt and pepper



  Pat chicken dry with paper towels and place chicken, breast side down, on a large cutting board. Using sharp kitchen shears, remove backbone by cutting along either side of it. Turn chicken over and lay out flat. Press firmly on breast to flatten chicken. For added stability, run skewers horizontally through chicken – through thighs and breasts, and through wings and breasts. Season generously with salt and pepper.



  Rub half of oil and lemon vinaigrette evenly all over surface of chicken, working into every nook and cranny.



  Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange coals on one side of charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.



  Place chicken, skin side up, on cooler side of grill with legs facing toward hotter side. Cover grill with vents on lid open and aligned over chicken. Open bottom vents of grill. Cook for about 30 - 45 minutes (120F internal temp). Carefully flip chicken and place on hotter side of grill, skin side down, with breasts pointed toward cooler side. Cover and cook for about 10 minutes longer (145F - 150F internal temp)



  Transfer chicken to cutting board and allow to rest 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, split remaining lemon in half and place on hotter side of grill, cut side down. Grill until well browned. Carve chicken, drizzle with remaining vinaigrette, and serve with lemon halves.
