  - 4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
  - 12 lasagna noodles
  - 16 ounces ricotta cheese
  - 1 egg
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced
  - 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

directions: |-
  In a large saucepan, fry ground beef or make meatballs, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, herbs, fennel seeds, red pepper, salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered with vent, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Adding water and/or red wine as enjoyed.

  Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. Or use no boil noodles! 

  In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

  To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil- make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.

  Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
