description: This is a deliciously authentic-tasting H&S, and so so easy.
ingredients:
  - 7 ounces tofu (extra firm)
  - 4 tablespoons soy sauce
  - 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
  - 3 tablespoons + 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
  - 1 boneless center-cut pork chop (about 6 ounces)
  - 1 large egg
  - 6 cups low-sodium chicken broth
  - 1 cup bamboo shoots (5 ounces)
  - 4 ounces fresh shitake mushrooms
  - 5 tablespoons Chinese black vingar (substitute 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
    plus 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar)
  - 2 teaspoons chili oil
  - 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
  - 3 medium scallions
directions: |-
  1) Place tofu on plate, set another plate on it, and weigh it down with several heavy cans; let stand 15 minutes, or until it has drained (about 8 ounces of liquid)

  2) Trim fat from pork chop and slice into 1 inch by 1/8 inch matchsticks

  3) Whisk 1 tablespoon soy sauce, sesame oil, and 1 teaspoon cornstarch in medium bowl; toss pork with marinade and set aside for 10-30 minutes.

  4) Remove stems from mushrooms, and slice caps about 1/4 inch thick.

  5) Combine 3 tablespoons cornstarch with 3 tablespoons water in small bowl and mix thoroughly; set aside. Mix remaining 1/2 teaspoon cornstach 1 teaspoon water; add egg, and beat with fork until combined. Set aside.

  6) Bring broth to boil in large bowl. Reduce heat to medium-low, add bamboo shoots and mushrooms andd simmer for about 5 minutes, or until mushrooms are tender.

  7) While broth simmers, dice tofu into 1/2 inch cubes. Add tofu and pork, including marinade, to soup, stirring to separate any pieces of pork that stick together. Continue to simmer until pork is no longer pink (about 2 minutes).

  8) Stir cornstarch mixture to recombine, and add to soup, increasing heat to medium-high. Cook about 1 minutes; stir in vinegar, chili oil, pepper, and remaining 3 tablespoons soy sauce. Turn off heat.

  9) Without stirring soup, use soupsoon to slowly drizzle thin streams of egg mixture into pot in circular motion. Let soup sit 1 minute, then return saucepan to medium-high heat. Bring to gentle boil, then immediately remove from heat. Gently stir soup once to evenly distribute egg; ladle into bowls, and top with scallions.
