description: Rich, delicious, and not too complex
ingredients:
  - 1 (3 pound) whole chicken
  - 2 teaspoons salt
  - 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
  - 1 teaspoon crushed garlic
  - 1 ½ cups thin coconut milk
  - 2 tablespoon cumin seeds
  - 1 tablespoon coriander seeds
  - 3 fresh red chilies, chopped
  - 1 teaspoon dried shrimp paste
  - 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
  - 2 teaspoon sugar
  - ⅓ cup roasted peanuts
  - ½ cup thick coconut milk
  - lemon or lime juice
  - chopped fresh cilantro
  - finely shredded fresh red chili
directions: |-
  Wash the chicken, dry well and season inside and out with the salt, pepper, and garlic. Place breast up in a deep saucepan and add the thin coconut milk. Cover and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 1 hour, turning the chicken after 30 minutes. Remove the chicken, cut into serving portions and set aside, covered.



  Toast the cumin, coriander seeds, chilies, and shrimp paste in a dry pan until aromatic, then grind together with the peanuts to form a smooth paste. Add paste, soy sauce, and sugar and stir into the coconut sauce. Bring to the boil, stirring occasionally, then simmer for 2-3 minutes. Add the thick coconut milk and stir the sauce consistently over moderate heat for 5 minutes. Return the chicken and simmer gently for 10-15 minutes.



  Lift the chicken and transfer to a serving dish. Flavor the sauce with lemon or lime juice and pour over the chicken. Garnish with cilantro and chili.
