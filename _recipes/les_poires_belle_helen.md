title: Les Poires Belle Helen
subtitle: Pears a la Port
description: null
ingredients:
  - 5 or so pears (relatively firm)
  - 1 bottle cheap/okay Port
  - 8 oz. (or so) semi-sweet chocolate
  - 1 tub of good vanilla ice cream
directions: |-
  1. Peal the pears and cut them in half. Use a knife or a spoon to cut out the center leaving what should work as a bowl.

  2. Pour your port into a deep saut√© pan (not a fry pan cause you need the sides to be high) and bring to a low boil.

  3. Move pan to low heat and submerge the pears in the port. Simmer this for 25-35 minutes (depending on pear ripeness) and let pears cool in port.

  4. Melt your chocolate how you like (I like to use a make-shift double boiler) 5 minutes before serving.

  5. Place pears on a desert plate (or a bowl depending on how fancy you're feeling) and put a hefty scoop of vanilla ice cream in it. Spoon the warm melted chocolate on top and serve.

  Tips:

  Start poaching the pears early - I usually start while cooking dinner.

  Keep heavy cream handy in base you botch the chocolate and it cools too early - helps to melt down re-hardened chocolate.

  Some people use water, lemon zest, lemon juice and vanilla to poach instead and mix brandy into the chocolate - not as good.
