  Boil macaroni noodles as directed until slightly al dente. Remove from stove and drain. Set aside. Cube ham, dice peppers, onions, and celery. Then saute ingredients  in 2 tbsp. butter until tender. 

  In a separate saucepan, melt 4 tbsp. of butter. Add 2 tbsp. of flour to melted butter, mixing well after each tbsp.  Wisk in 2 cups of milk slowly and stir for about 3 minutes or until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat.
