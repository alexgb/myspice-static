description: New Orleans Sausage & Corn
ingredients:
  - 4 large ears corn, husks removed and thrown out, keep the silks
  - Salt
  - 2 tablespoons butter
  - 1/2 cup diced tasso or andouille sausage
  - 1/2 onion, chopped
  - 1/2 cup diced bell pepper
  - 2 tablespoons minced garlic
  - 1 cup diced Roma tomatoes
  - 1/4 to 1/2 cup corn-silk tea (directions below)
  - 1 teaspoon cornstarch, mixed with a bit of water to make a paste (for
    thickening)
  - 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
directions: |-
  1. With a sharp knife, slice the kernels off the cob and set aside, and reserve one of the cobs.

  2. Make the corn-silk tea by breaking one reserved cob in half and adding it to a small saucepan with the silks, 1 1/2 cups water, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, turn off heat, and let steep.

  3. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add tasso or andouille and saute until meat renders fat. Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic and saute until tender. Add tomatoes and corn kernels; cover and cook for a few minutes until corn is tender.

  4. Uncover and drain silks from the steeped tea and add a little of the tea to the mixture. Add corn-flour paste; cook and stir until thickened slightly. Stir in basil.
