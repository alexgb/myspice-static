  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
  - 1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
  - 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

  - 1 lemon, halved
  - 1/4 cup mixed chopped flat leaf parsley and cilantro
  - 1 whole (4 quarters) salt-preserved lemon

  - coarse salt
directions: |-
  1. Mix together the spices in a bowl, set aside. In another bowl soak the olives in cold water.

  2. Rinse, thoroughly dry, and lightly salt the chicken pieces (including wing tips, back, neck, gizzard, and heart) (keep liver aside). Heat the butter and oil in a pan and brown the chicken in two batches on both sides and set aside.

  3. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan. Add the onion and garlic sauté until soft (about 3 minutes). Stir in the spice mix and sauté for a minute longer.

  4. Pour in the water to deglaze the pan.

  5. When the water is boiling return the browned chicken pieces to the pan excluding the breasts. Tuck the liver between the pieces. Cover and reduce heat to low and braise for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes check heat level and make sure it's only lightly simmering, turn the chicken pieces over and place the breasts skin side down on top of the legs and wings. Squeeze half the lemon over the chicken and sprinkle half the chopped herbs. Continue to braise for 20 minutes.

  6. Pit and rinse the olives. Rinse the preserved lemon under cool water, and discard the pulp. Chop the peel into 1/2 inch pieces.

  7. After the chicken has braised for a total of 30 minutes add the olives and preserved lemon and turn the chicken pieces again.

  8.  Remove the liver from the pan and mash into a paste using a fork.

  9. Continue braising until the chicken is cooked through, 40-45 minutes total. Once finished remove the chicken pieces from the pan and discard the wing tips, back, neck, heart, and gizzard.

  10. Increase the heat under the braising liquid and return to a boil. Mix in the liver, squeeze in the remaining lemon, and reduce for about 5 minutes. Mix in the fresh herbs and salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the sauce over the chicken and serve.
