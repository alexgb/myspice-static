subtitle: Stir-Fried Cucumbers with Beef
description: "A savory but not sweet stir-fry that has a light and thin sauce. "
ingredients:
  - 8 ounces lean rump or fillet of beef
  - 2 teaspoons sesame oil
  - 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 1/2 teaspoon sugar
  - 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
  - 2 large green cucumbers
  - 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
  - 2 tablespoons toasted, crushed sesame seeds
  - 1 tablespoon lime juice
directions: |-
  Freeze the beef for a short time to make it firm enough to cut into paper-thin slices. Slices should be about 2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide. Put the beef in a bowl and add sesame oil, soy sauce, salt, sugar, cayenne and lime juice. Mix with the hand so flavorings penetrate meat.

  Peel cucumbers, leaving a thin strip of green skin at intervals for decorative effect. Cut in halves lengthwise, scoop out seeds then cut crosswise into medium-thin slices.

  Heat vegetable oil in a wok, swirl to coat with oil, add beef and stir fry on high heat for 1 minute. Add cucumbers and toss for a further minute, then let mixture simmer until cucumber is half cooked. Cucumber should be tender but still crisp.

  Garnish with sesame seeds and serve hot with white rice.
