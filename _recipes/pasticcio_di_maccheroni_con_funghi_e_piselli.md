directions: |-
  To make the pastry, stir together 3.5 cups of the flour and the salt in a large bowl. Cut i the butter with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the eggs and wine and mix until the dough comes together in a rough mass, adding more flour if needed. Alternatively, place the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse briefly to mix. Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the eggs and wine and pulse to incorporate. Divide the dough into 2 balls, one slightly larger than the other. Place in a plastic bag and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.

  On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the larger ball of dough into a round about 15 inches in diameter. Ease it into a deep 10 inch springform pan. Refrigerate. Roll out the remaining ball of dough into a 12 inch round and refrigerate.

  To make the filling, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the pasta, stir well, cook until almost tender, and drain. Place in a bowl and toss with a little olive oil. Set aside.

  Warm the 4 tablespoons olive oil or melt the butter in a saute pan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until softened, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic, rosemary, and chopped rehydrated mushrooms and cook, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes longer. Add the fresh mushrooms and continue to cook over medium heat until the mushrooms give off their liquid, about 8 minutes.

  Add the reserved mushroom liquid to the saute pan along with the peas or peas and carrots. Stir in the salt and pepper and season with the nutmeg (if using). Add to the cooked pasta, toss well, and fold in the grated cheese.

  Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F.

  Spoon the pasta mixture into the pastry-lined pan. Top with the pastry round, turn under the edges and seal well, pinching the edges together. Cut a few slits in the top crust, then brush with the egg mixture.

  Bake until golden, 35 to 40. Let rest for 10 minutes before cutting. Serve hot.

  FOR THE MEAT VERSION (Pasticcio di Maccheroni con Polpettine):

  Make the pastry as directed, using olive oil, or chicken or goose fat in place of the butter. Season 1.5 lbs ground beef with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and freshly grated nutmeg. Form into little meatballs and fry them in olive oil until cooked through. Add to the cooked pasta along with 2 onions, chopped, and .5 lbs chicken livers, both sauteed in olive oil. Omit the cheese and brush the pastry with egg yolk mixed with water, not milk. Fill and bake as directed. Let rest for 10 minutes before cutting. Serve hot.
