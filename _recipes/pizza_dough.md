subtitle: Pizza Dough
description: Basic pizza dough from the New York Times
ingredients:
  - 3 cups all-purpose or bread flour, or more as needed, plus more for kneading
  - 1 teaspoon fast-rising yeast (2 teaspoons if you're in a hurry)
  - 2 teaspoons salt, plus more for sprinkling
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as necessary
  - Rosemary, optional.
directions: |-
  Put the flour, yeast, salt, and olive oil in a food processor. Turn the machine on and add 1 cup water through the feed tube. Process until the mixture forms a slightly sticky ball, about 30 seconds. Add more water or flour as needed to get the right consistency.

  Using a little flower show the dough into a ball; wrap in plastic. Let rest at room temperature until the dough doubles in size, 1 to 2 hours. 

  Reshape the dough into a ball and cut in half, forming 2 balls. (From here on, use olive oil if you're cooking on baking sheets, flour if on a pizza stone.) Put them on a lightly floured surface (a pizza peel is ideal), sprinkle with flour and cover with plastic wrap; or brush then with a bit of oil and place on a lightly oiled sheet. Let rest for about 20 minutes, while you heat the oven to 500 degrees.

  Press a dough ball into a 1/2-inch-thick flat round, adding flour or oil to the work surface as necessary. Press or roll the dough until it's as thin as you can make it; let it rest a bit if it becomes too elastic. (Patience is your friend here.) You can do two baking sheets at once, or one after another, as you'll have to if using a peel. If doing the latter, slide the dough from the peel onto the stone.
