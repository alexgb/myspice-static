  - 2 leeks
  - ½ cup peanut oil
  - 6 oz groud beef
  - 2 ½ tablesp chili bean paste
  - 1 tablesp fermented black beans
  - 2 teasp ground chili (or less – this is hot!)
  - 1 cup chicken stock
  - 1 teasp sugar
  - 2 teasp light soy sauce
  - Salt to taste (Iâ€™m not sure I use any)
  - 4 tablesp corn starch mixed with 6 tablesp water
  - ½ teasp ground roasted Sichuan pepper, ground
directions: |-
  Cut bean curd in 1 inch cubes and steep in hot or gently simmering water, lightly salted.

  Slice leeks thinly.

  Heat oil in wok till smoking add minced beef and stir fry till crisp and a little brown, but not too dry.

  Turn heat down to medium and add chili bean paste, stir fry 30 secs, until oil rich red color, add fermented black beans and chili and stir fry another 20-30 secs.

  Pour in the stock, add leeks, sugar, soy sauce and salt.  Cook till leeks just cooked, then add bean curd, stir gently, heat through.  Add corn starch gradually, stirring between each addition until sauce coats meat and other ingredients – do not add too much.  Sprinkle with Sichuan pepper and serve.

  (My note: I think this may be too much oil, I think I use less.  Also you probably don’t need all the corn starch)
