description: |
  These cookies are quite lemony and quick.  I found the recipe in a rachel ray mag - they were a hit and an easy dessert for a dinner party.  
ingredients:
  - 1 stick of butter
  - 1 1/4 cups sugar
  - Zest of 2 lemons
  - 1 tbsp lemon juice
  - 1 egg
  - 1 1/2 cups flour
  - 1/4 tsp baking soda
  - 1/4 tsp salt
directions: |-
  Oven 350

  Line 3 cookie sheets with parchment paper for quick clean up or 

  In large bowl combine butter, 1 cup sugar, lemon peel and juice.  Use an electric mixer to combine.  Add egg, then flour, baking soda, and salt.  Mix. 

  Put 1/4 cup sugar in small bowl.  Roll heaping teaspoons of dough into balls and roll in sugar.  Put on the cookie sheets a couple inches apart. 

  Bake 15 minutes.   

  Makes about 2-3 dozen cookies, which equates to about 4-6 servings for my husband.
