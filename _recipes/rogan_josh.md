  Prepare, cut, and salt meat. 



  Add milk and saffron in a small bowl and set aside.



  Use sauté setting on pressure cooker, add ghee, and brown meat on all sides in batches.



  Remove meat and add bay leaves, cinnamon, chilies, cardamom, and cloves and stir until fragrant, about 15 seconds.



  Stir in onion, garlic, and ginger and sauté until onions are golden, about 7-10 minutes.



  Add coriander, cumin, chili powder, paprika, and black pepper and stir fry for 30 seconds.



  Return the meat to the pot and stir to coat with the spices.



  Add yoghurt, one tablespoon at a time until incorporated into the sauce, about 30 seconds to 1 minute each time.



  Add broth and saffron milk, then close the lid of pressure cooker. Cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes for brisket, or 45 minutes for lamb.



  Let pressure release naturally. Remove meat and set aside. Remove whole spices and discard.



  Use an immersion blender to blend the sauce. If necessary cook further to thicken.



  Add cilantro to sauce, combine with meat, and serve.
