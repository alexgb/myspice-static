  - 1 onion, finely chopped (1 cup)
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 2 cups farro (12 ounces), rinsed and drained
  - 3 mini (or Persian) seedless cucumbers (7 ounces)
  - 1 small head radicchio (5 ounces)
  - ⅓ cup packed finely chopped dill
  - 4 boneless salmon fillets (4 ounces each, and about 1-inch thick)
  - ""
  - "Dressing:"
  - 2 ½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more for serving
  - 1 garlic clove, finely grated or minced
  - ¼ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed
  - ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed
  - 3 tablespoons tahini
directions: |+
  Pre heat oven to 400.





  Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet with a lid over medium heat. Add onion, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring often, until starting to turn clear, about 3 minutes. Add farro and cook until the pan is dry and the farro smells toasty, about 2 minutes. Stir in 2 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil, then cover skillet, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes.



  While the farro is cooking place the salmon in a lightly oiled pan and cook for about 10 minutes, until just cooked through.



  Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together lemon juice, garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Let sit for 1 minute, then whisk in oil, a few drops at a time, until emulsified. Whisk in tahini and set aside.



  Cut the cucumbers in quarters lengthwise, then slice into 1/2-inch slices crosswise (you should have 2 cups); add to a large mixing bowl. Quarter and core the radicchio, then thinly slice into 1/4-inch strips (you should have 3 cups); add to the bowl. Add dill, add 2 tablespoons of dressing and a pinch each of salt and pepper to the bowl, and toss until evenly coated.



  Toss cooked farro with 5 to 6 tablespoons tahini dressing to taste, a large pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil. Taste, and add salt and olive oil if needed.



  Serve farro in bowls with vegetables and salmon on top.
