title: Salmon en Salsa Verde
subtitle: Salmon with Green Salsa
description: Vivid gren and tart flavored, cilantro sauce perfectly accents the
  exquisite pink flesh of salmon.
ingredients:
  - 4 lbs salmon fillets
  - 3/4 cup lime juice
  - 2/3 cup thinly sliced green onions (including tops)
  - 2 pickled jalapeno chiles, stemmed and finely chopped
  - 1 1/2 cups loosely packed fresh cilantro (coriander) leaves, minced
  - 1/3 cup olive oil
directions: |-
  Lay fillets, skin sides down, in a 9 by 13 inch baking pan. Evenly drizzle 2 tablespoons of the lime juice over fillets. 

  In a small bowl, combine remaining lime juice, green onions, chiles, cilantro, and olive oil. Spread 1/2 cup of the cilantro mixture over a fillet; lay other fillet, skin side up, atop first. (At this point, you may cover and refrigerate for up to a day.)

  Bake, uncovered, in a 350Â° oven until fish is just slightly translucent or wet inside when cut in thickest part (35 to 45 minutes). If desired, pull off top skin; slice through fish just down to bottom fillet and lift off portions with a spatula. Spoon remaining salsa over individual servings.
servings: "8"
