directions: |-
  Meatballs: 

  Soak breadcrumbs in milk in medium bowl 10 minutes. Mix in onion, eggs and seasonings. Add meats and beat with electric mixer or wooden spoon until light and fluffy.  Handling gently, form mixture into 2-inch diameter meatballs.  Smooth balls between moistened palms.  Place in baking pan. Refrigerate until firm.

  Melt Butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add meatballs in batches (do not crowd) and cook until brown on all sides, shaking pan occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Drain on paper towels; reserve drippings in skillet.  Layer meatballs in deep 4-quart oven-proof casserole or baking dish.

  Gravy:  

  Measure pan drippings and return 3 tablespoons to skillet adding butter if necessary.  Add onion and cook over medium-low heat until tender, about 8 minutes.  Gradually mix in consommé and cream.  Simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Season with pepper.  Strain over meatballs.  (can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before continuing.)

  Preheat oven to 275°F.  Bake casserole until meatballs are heated through, about 45 minutes.
