description: "I used to make these all the time and they continue to be my
  favorite hamburger. I can't vouch for their authenticity but they are
  certainly an interesting take on an American classic. Best served on a summer
  grill. "
ingredients:
  - 1 lb uncooked finely minced lamb
  - 1 onion
  - 2 cloves garlic
  - 1/2 inch fresh root ginger
  - 1 teaspoon chili powder
  - 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
  - 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds

  - 1/2 teaspoon garam masala
  - 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  - 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
  - 1 pinch ground cloves
  - 1 tablespoon gram flour
  - 1 tablespoon dessicated coconut, soaked in 1 tablespoon hot water
  - 1 pinch salt
  - 2 ounces cream cheese
  - 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
directions: |-
  Chop the onion, garlic and ginger finely. Combine in a mixing bowl with all the other ingredients except the cream cheese and mint. Mix thoroughly.

  Blend the cream cheese with the finely chopped mint leaves. Now divide the meat into 12 equal portions. Flatten each portion in the palm of the hand. Put a teaspoon of the cream cheese in the center and draw up the meat around it. Enclose completely, then flatten gently into a round, flat patty like a hamburger. Fry in a little oil or grill until brown. Serve with onion rings and rice.
