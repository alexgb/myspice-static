directions: |-
  1.

  In a large saucepan, bring 1 3/4 cups of water to a boil with butter and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.

  Remove from heat, add flour and stir vigorously until incorporated.

  Return to moderate heat and cook, stirring until dough pulls away from the side. 3 mintes. Remove from heat.

  2.

  Using and electric mixer, beat dough at low for 1 minute, until just slightly cooled.

  Increase speed to medium-high and beat in the eggs and egg white, one at a time.

  Transfer the dough to a bowl, press a sheet of plastic wrap directly on surface and refridgerate until room temperature, about 15 minutes.

  3. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, heat the milk with 1/2 cup of water until small bubbles appear around the edge. 

  Add the chocolate, cocoa powder, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the sugar and a pinch of salt and whisk over low heat until the the chocolate is melted.

  Keep warm over very low heat.

  4. In another large saucepan, heat the oil to 375. 

  Set a rack on a large baking sheet and cover with paper towels. 

  In a pie plate or shallow bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar with the cinnamon. Scoop the dough into a large pastry bag fitted with large star tip.

  5. Working quickly, squeeze 6-inch lengths of dough into the hot oil, cutting them off with a knife. Fry no more than 8 churros at a time, as they expand when cooked.  

  Fry over moderate heat, turning once or twice, until browned, about 8 minutes. 

  Drain churros on the rack for 2 minutes, then toss with cinnamon sugar in the pie plate.

  Serve immediately with hot chocolate!

  Oh yeah!
